        <p>Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles <br>
            Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble <br>
            Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines <br>
            Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)</p>
        <p> Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch <br>
            Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage? <br>
            Rather be tied up with calls and not strings <br>
            Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)</p>
        <p> My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossin' <br>
            Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin' <br>
            You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it </p>
        <p> I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah) <br>
            I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it <br>
            I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it <br>

        <p> Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs." <br>
            Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches <br>
            I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches <br>
            Think retail therapy my new addiction</p>
        <p> Whoever said money can't solve your problems <br>
            Must not have had enough money to solve 'em <br>
            They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em" <br>
            Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms</p>
        <p> My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin' <br>
            The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it) <br>
            I bought a crib just for the closet <br>
            Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah</p>

            You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah) <br>
            I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)</p>
        <p> Yeah, my receipts, be lookin' like phone numbers <br>
            If it ain't money, then wrong number <br>
            Black card is my business card <br>
            The way it be settin' the tone for me <br>
            I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag, " yeah <br>
            When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah <br>
            Shoot, go from the store to the booth <br>
            Make it all back in one loop, give me the loot <br>
            Never mind, I got the juice <br>
            Nothing but net when we shoot <br>
            Look at my neck, look at my jet <br>
            Ain't got enough money to pay me respect <br>
            Ain't no budget when I'm on the set <br>
            If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah</p>
        <p> I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Yeah) <br>
